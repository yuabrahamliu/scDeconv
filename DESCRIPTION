Description: Many DNA methylation (DNAm) data are generated from tissues with 
    various cell types, so cell deconvolution methods are needed to accurately 
	infer their cell compositions. However, a bottleneck for DNAm data is the 
	lack of cell type specific DNAm references. On the other hand, scRNA-seq 
	data are being accumulated rapidly with various cell type transcriptomic 
	signatures characterized. Hence, the R package scDeconv is developed to 
	deconvolve bulk DNAm data from scRNA-seq data in a trans-omics manner and 
	solve the reference deficiency problem of DNAm data.
